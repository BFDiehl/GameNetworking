DefinitionLibrary.dll
by Jordan Diehl

Included is an example of use for this dll use DictionaryDefinition::DefinitionClass::GetDefinition(String word) to query dictionary.com for a definition of the input string.

This is my first attempt at a dll and I have found that you must manually place it in the top folder then also make a copy in the debug folder. I don't know if both these are normally neccesary but they are with my dll.
